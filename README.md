> Fast, Robust and Tunning-Free Regularized Covariance Matrix Estimators

## How To Install?
```r
library('devtools')
install_github(repo = "davidnexer/impcov")
```

## Regularization Methods
* Ledoit-Wolf (LW) Shrinkage Estimator  [1]
* Oracle Approximating Shrinkage (OAS) Estimator [2]
* Schafer-Strimmer (SS) Shrinkage Estimator [3]
* Reduced-Rank Estimator based on Probabilistic PCA (PPCA) [4]
* Sparse Reduced-Rank Estimator based on Sparse Principal Components (SPC) [5]
* Sparse Estimator based on Penalized Likelihood with Quadratic Approximation (QUIC) [6]

## Coming Soon
* Regularization of a covariance matrix estimate given by the user;
* Weighted estimation based on sample weights given by the user.
